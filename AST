Here's a structured approach to developing a simple rule engine application using an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to evaluate user eligibility based on various attributes.
1. Data Structure
We'll define a Node class to represent the AST:

python
Copy code
class Node:
    def __init__(self, node_type, value=None, left=None, right=None):
        self.node_type = node_type  # "operator" or "operand"
        self.value = value           # e.g., comparison value or operator
        self.left = left             # left child
        self.right = right           # right child

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Node(type={self.node_type}, value={self.value})"
2. Data Storage
Database Choice:
For this application, we could use a NoSQL database like MongoDB for flexibility with schema changes, or an SQL database for structured querying.

Schema Example (if using MongoDB):

json
Copy code
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "rule_id": "1",
      "rule_string": "((age > 30 AND department = 'Sales') OR (age < 25 AND department = 'Marketing')) AND (salary > 50000 OR experience > 5)",
      "ast": {} // JSON representation of the AST
    },
    {
      "rule_id": "2",
      "rule_string": "((age > 30 AND department = 'Marketing')) AND (salary > 20000 OR experience > 5)",
      "ast": {}
    }
  ]
}
3. API Design
We can define the following API functions:

3.1 Create Rule
python
Copy code
def create_rule(rule_string):
    # Parse the rule_string and build the AST
    # This is a simplified example; a full parser would be more complex
    return parse_rule(rule_string)

def parse_rule(rule_string):
    # Implement a parser that builds the AST based on the rule_string
    # For simplicity, let's assume a basic parsing mechanism here
    # Return a root Node
    pass
3.2 Combine Rules
python
Copy code
def combine_rules(rules):
    # Combine rules into a single AST
    # Consider operator frequency and other strategies
    root = None
    for rule in rules:
        ast = create_rule(rule)
        root = combine_ast(root, ast)
    return root

def combine_ast(ast1, ast2):
    # Implement logic to combine two ASTs
    # This can vary based on desired logic (e.g., AND/OR combinations)
    pass
3.3 Evaluate Rule
python
Copy code
def evaluate_rule(ast, data):
    # Recursively evaluate the AST against the provided data
    if ast.node_type == "operand":
        # Handle comparison based on the value and type
        return evaluate_operand(ast, data)
    elif ast.node_type == "operator":
        # Evaluate based on the left and right nodes
        return evaluate_operator(ast, data)

def evaluate_operand(node, data):
    # Implement operand evaluation
    # e.g., age > 30
    pass

def evaluate_operator(node, data):
    # Implement operator evaluation (AND/OR)
    pass
4. Test Cases
Test 1: Create Individual Rules
python
Copy code
rule1 = create_rule("((age > 30 AND department = 'Sales') OR (age < 25 AND department = 'Marketing')) AND (salary > 50000 OR experience > 5)")
rule2 = create_rule("((age > 30 AND department = 'Marketing')) AND (salary > 20000 OR experience > 5)")
Test 2: Combine Rules
python
Copy code
combined_rule = combine_rules([rule1, rule2])
Test 3: Evaluate Rule
python
Copy code
data = {"age": 35, "department": "Sales", "salary": 60000, "experience": 3}
result = evaluate_rule(combined_rule, data)  # Should return True or False
Test 4: Explore Additional Rules
python
Copy code
# Create more rules and evaluate
Bonus Features
Error Handling: Implement checks to validate rule strings and data formats.
Attribute Validation: Maintain a catalog of valid attributes.
Rule Modification: Add functions to modify existing rules or attributes within the AST.
User-defined Functions: Consider extending the rule language to support user-defined conditions.
This structure sets the foundation for your rule engine, and you can expand on it based on specific needs or requirements.
